Chrome-Node
===========

Chrome-Node is a plugin/extension for Google Chrome which allows node scripts to be run in the browser.

It uses the libuv library to provide most of Nodes functionality, v8 is not required obviously because it runs within Chrome.

It also uses the http_parser library that is also used in Node.

Building
--------

Chrome-Node can be built with Visual Studio.


TODO
----

* Support multiple browsers
* Complete support for Nodes included libraries
* Supply a working demo
